## 🎨 UI Enhancements We're Looking For

We're particularly interested in UI enhancements related to Three.js. Some ideas include:

1. **3D Background Elements**: Create subtle, interactive 3D elements for the background using Three.js.
2. **Animated Transitions**: Implement smooth 3D transitions between different sections of the portfolio.
3. **Interactive Project Showcases**: Develop 3D models or animations to showcase projects in a more engaging way.
4. **Particle Effects**: Add particle systems to create dynamic, eye-catching effects on the home page.
5. **3D Skill Visualization**: Create a 3D visualization of skills or technologies, perhaps as an interactive sphere or network.

## 🌓 Dark and Light Mode

We're also looking to implement a toggle for dark and light mode. When working on this:

- Ensure all components support both modes
- Use CSS variables for color schemes to make switching easy
- Consider animation for smooth transitions between modes
- Implement local storage to remember user preference
